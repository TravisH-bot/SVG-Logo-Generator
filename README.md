## Description

The SVG Logo Generator is designed to take user inputs via prompts. The user will be asked to enter up to 3 letters, a color for their text, a style of shape (circle, square, or triangle), and the color for their shape. Once all four questions are answered, then a logo.svg file will be generated.
